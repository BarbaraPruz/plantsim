## Environment and Controls
Here are the rules 
    Each 'day', the moisture automatically decreases by 5.  If moisture is over 75, pH will decrease by 0.1.
    Otherwise, pH will increase by 0.05.

    User control adjustments:
    - the light value just becomes the new light level.
    - water: low water adds 2.5, medium water adds 5 (so break even), high water adds 10.
    - fertilizer and pH: peat reduces pH -0.25.  lime increases pH 0.25

## How the Plant Grows based on Environment values
    - Growth is based on the combined values for water, pH, and light.  Each step can range from -0.5 to 1.
    - Values are rated as follows:
        - Moisture: Best Range is 50-60, Good is 40-50 or 60-80, OK is 30-40 or 80-90, otherwise poor.
        - Light: Best Range is 70-100, Good is 40-70, OK is 25-40.  Below 25 is poor.
        - pH: Best is 5.9-6.1, Good is 5.5-5.9 or 6.1-6.5, OK is 5.0-5.5 or 6.5-7.0.  otherwise poor.
